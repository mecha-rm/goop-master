Notes:
In order for the visuals to matchup with the visuals properly, the window must be maximized.
I don't understand why this is, but that's just how the toolkit handles resizing.
The audio source box starts in front of the user. The user itself is visualized as facing towards negative infinity on the y-axis.
I did not do the bonus on this assignment.
